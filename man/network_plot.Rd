\title{Network plot of a correlation data frame}
\usage{
network_plot(rdf, min_cor = 0.3, legend = FALSE, colours = c("indianred2",
  "white", "skyblue1"), colors)
}
\arguments{
\item{rdf}{Correlation data frame (cor_df) created with \code{\link{correlate}}.}

\item{min_cor}{Number from 0 to 1 indicating the minimum value of
correlations (in absolute terms) to plot.}

\item{legend}{Boolean indicating whether a legend mapping the colours to the correlations should be displayed.}

\item{colours, colors}{Vector of colours to use for n-colour gradient.}
}
\description{
Output a network plot of a correlation data frame in which variables that are
more highly correlated appear closer together and are joined by stronger
paths. Paths are also coloured by their sign (blue for positive and red for
negative). The proximity of the points are determined using multidimensional
clustering.
}
\examples{
x <- correlate(mtcars)
network_plot(x)
network_plot(x, min_cor = .1)
network_plot(x, min_cor = .6)
network_plot(x, min_cor = .7, colors = c("red", "green"), legend = TRUE)
}
